Chemistry simulations using interactive graphic user interfaces (GUI) represent uniquely effective and safe tools to support multi-dimensional learning. Computer literacy and coding skills have become increasingly important in the chemical sciences. In response to both these facts, a series of Jupyter notebooks hosted on Google Colaboratory were developed for undergraduate students enrolled in Physical Chemistry. These modules were developed for use during the COVID19 pandemic when Millsaps College courses were virtual, and only virtual or online labs could be used. These interactive exercises employ the Python programming language to explore a variety of chemical problems related to kinetics, the Maxwellâ€“Boltzmann distribution, numerical versus analytical solutions, and real-world application of concepts. Accessibility was prioritized and students were assumed to have no prior programming experience; the notebooks are cost-free and browser based. Students were guided to use widgets to build interactive GUIs that provide dynamic representations, immediate access to multiple investigations, and interaction with key variables. To evaluate the perceived effectiveness of this introduction to Python programming, participants were surveyed at the beginning and end of the course to gauge their interest in pursuing programming and data analysis skills and how they viewed the importance of programming and data analysis for their future careers. Student reactions were generally positive and showed increased interest in programming and its importance in their futures, so these notebooks will be incorporated into the in-person laboratory in the future.

Content will be periodically updated to fix bugs and add and improve content.

##Using Material
First, I'd love to hear how people are using this book. Second, this book may receive updates with additional content, clarifications, and corrections, so if you want a static copy of the book to use during the academic term, below are multiple options.

1. Download copies of each notebook to share with your students. At the top right of each file, click the download button.

2. 

2. Fork this repository to your GitHub page and have your students use your copy - create a GitHub account, fork this repository, build the book using Jupyter Book, and have you students use your copy on your GitHub page. You can update your fork of this repository at any time to received any updates, and unlike a PDF copy, this approach makes it easier for students to copy-and-paste code from the chapters. The approach does require the user be confortable using git and GitHub.
